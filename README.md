Also download dataset.7z and unzip it to the same path.
and that's it.

If want to capture own data create a folder capture_vid in same directory and run the method capture_sample_data
that will start capturing your face via a webcam in iterations on press of 'space'

just run the recognizer.py after a few mandatory installations(if haven't done any)
